/**
 * 
 * This class represents the "Editor" that will edit TextFile object, which will
 * later be converted in .txt files in the future. Some of examples of this class's 
 * functionality include its ability to create TextFile objects, edit its contents,
 * print its contents, and convert its contents into a .txt file, which will be saved in
 * the directory of this program.
 * 
 * 
 * STEP 1 and STEP 2 FILE FILE COMPRESSION RECORDS/REFLECTION:
 * Below are the data and reflections I collected after running and comparing the efficiency
 * of my compression algorithm compared to the regular editor. In the directory, there is a folder
 * that contains the text files I used to compare eachother. Each text file's .cmp or .txt equivalent
 * contains the same "words".  
 * 
 * (Each number is in bytes. The first number represents the .cmp size and the second .txt size)
 * 
 * TextFiles:
 * Darth Plagueis: 984, 762
 * Marcus Intro: 193, 133
 * Hi My Name Is: 183, 194
 * Name Trial: 98, 102
 * Yoda Trial: 125, 159
 * 
 * From this data, it is pretty clear that this compressor is not 100% effective and efficient; 
 * the "Darth Plagueis" and "Marcus Intro" trials ended up having "compressed" files that are 
 * bigger than their .txt counterparts! This is likely due to because both of these have an increased
 * amount of unique words â€“ therefore the use of dictionary isn't as efficient. In addition, in the 
 * Darth Plagueis trial, I included punctuation, where a word like "hello" and "hello!" are considered 
 * different for the compiler creating more space in the .cmp file.
 * 
 * However, fortunately for the majority of the trials, the compressor was able to shrink the size of the 
 * file (albeit by a marginal amount.) This is likely because these files used an increased amount of 
 * repeated words, allowing the dictionary to be of greater efficiency. Indeed, their small size
 * restricts the dictionary from being more useful as the less amount of text there is, the more room for
 * unique words to be used more often than common, ZIPF words.
